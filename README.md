# TinyNeuralNetwork
## Disclaimer
When I wrote this code , I hadn`t know Python 
language at all, thats why the code is ugly.(Today I have level-up) 
Nevertheless, your first Neural Network will always be
exiting experience for you :)
## Network description
The network is represented by one class.
It has one input layer,three hidden layers
and three output.
Full trainig cycle takes 15 minutes(its normal situation).
But recognizing can be done using 
files with weights below(network import them automaticly).
Some descriptions about partial derivatives are taking place
in the code.
Training base,that contains 300 images of three brands,
is not included(download takes a lot of time).
Running without training base will throw an exeption.
