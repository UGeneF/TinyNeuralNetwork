# TinyNeuralNetwork
The network is represented by one class.
It has one input layer,three hidden layers
and three output.
Full trainig cycle takes 15 minutes(its normal situation).
But recognizing can be done using 
files with weights below(network import them automaticly).
Some descriptions about partial derivatives are taking place
in the code.
